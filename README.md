## Welcome to Toggles Me Source Code!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), [Tailwind CSS](tailwindcss.com/) and a little help from [canvas-confetti](https://github.com/catdad/canvas-confetti).

## What is it?

A stupid webapp to create and share silly toggles with friends and help increase the amount of sillyness in the world.

Open [https://toggles.me/](https://toggles.me/) with your browser to see the result.

Aimed to run without a back-end for sharing to keep everything in the browser and protect users privacy. Using base64 and URI encoding it allows for sharing links to be decoded by the app - all in the browser (have I said that yet?).
